# Diffusion Segmentation Project for ETH Deep Learning A23

This repository currently builds directly on the **[DiffSeg](https://github.com/PotatoTian/DiffSeg)** paper but we will probably want to rewrite the DiffSeg-specific parts in PyTorch on top of the **[Local Prompt Mixing (LPM)](https://github.com/orpatashnik/local-prompt-mixing)** code instead.
